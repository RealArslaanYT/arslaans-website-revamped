### Hi, I'm Arslaan!

# I'm a 12-year-old developer exploring programming, Linux, FOSS, iOS jailbreaking, embedded systems, robotics, and game development.

<details class="about-me">
  <summary>Read more about me</summary>
  <div markdown="1">

I like computer science, writing stories (sometimes), Linux, FOSS (Free Open-Source Software), hacking, reverse-engineering and iOS jailbreaking. My favorite genre of music is Hyperpop, particularly Hyperpop-Digicore & Hyperpop-Glitchcore. One of my best (and most recent) projects is a CSS-in-JS library called styl1sh.js that aims to make CSS more powerful and allows you to create dynamic styles.

I mainly use riced MacOS on my M2 MacBook Pro with a custom tiling window manager setup, custom-mapped keyboard shortcuts and a custom menu bar (thanks to yabai, skhd, SketchyBar, and JankyBorders) for daily-driving and most development/coding. My favorite games are Minecraft and Stick Fight: The Game. I’ve been programming and tinkering with devices since the age of six. What originally got me into programming was looking at my old iPad 2 (which I still have as of 2025, six years later - it's now jailbroken with [EtasonJB](https://etasonjb.tihmstar.net/){: target="_blank" } because I felt like it) and saying – “how are these apps made?”

Feel free to explore my projects, stories, and achievements, and thanks for stopping by!
