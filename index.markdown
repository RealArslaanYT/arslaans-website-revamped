### Hi, I'm Arslaan!

# I'm a 13-year-old developer exploring programming, Linux, FOSS, iOS jailbreaking, embedded systems, robotics, and game development.

<details class="about-me">
  <summary>Read more about me</summary>
  <div markdown="1">

I like computer science, writing stories (sometimes), Linux, FOSS (Free Open-Source Software), hacking, reverse-engineering and iOS jailbreaking. My favorite genre of music is Hyperpop, particularly Hyperpop-Digicore & Hyperpop-Glitchcore. I'm currently the project lead at Pidjon Enterprises, a small team of people building voice-controlled companion robots with custom embedded Linux. I also work on various other projects in web development, system programming, and hardware hacking.

I mainly use Arch Linux ARM on my M2 MacBook Pro (thanks to the [Asahi Linux](https://asahilinux.org){: target="_blank" } project) with the Hyprland tiling window manager along with waybar, wofi, hyprlock, and more. My favorite games are osu!, Minecraft and Stick Fight: The Game. I’ve been programming and tinkering with devices since somewhere around the age of six. What originally got me into programming was looking at my old iPad 2 (which I still have as of 2025, six years later - it's now jailbroken with [EtasonJB](https://etasonjb.tihmstar.net/){: target="_blank" } because I felt like it) and saying – “how are these apps made?”

Feel free to explore my projects, stories, and achievements, and thanks for stopping by!
